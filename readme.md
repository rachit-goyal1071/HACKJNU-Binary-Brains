We use CCTV cameras a lot when trying to solve a crime or identify the criminal, so why not crank it up a notch and use those cameras not just for recording the crime but also to detect it and notify the responsible authorities?

## UNO and it's SDGs

Out of the 17 available SDGs listed by the UNO, Super-Vision aligns with the ideas of SDG 16 and also lightly touch SDGs 3,9 and 11. **SDG 16** states **"Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels"**

- Target 16.1 - Reduce Violence Everywhere

- Target 16.3 - Rule of Law and Equal Access to Justice

- Target 16.7 - Inclusive Decision-Making

## Solution Overview
An AI-based intelligent home security system to automate real-time video analysis, efficient decision-making, and targeted threat detection. This system will recognize violent behaviors and promptly notify homeowners or authorities as necessary.

## Key Features
**AI-Based System:** Utilizes machine learning for automatic real-time video analysis.

**Advanced Algorithms:** Implements smart camera algorithms to differentiate between normal and suspicious activities.

**Identify Violent Behaviors:** Detects aggressive actions, fights, or other violent behaviors within the camera's view.

**Machine Learning Techniques:** Adapts and refines decision-making skills based on continuous feedback.

**Triggers for Suspicious Activity:** Establishes real-time triggers to identify anomalies in home environments.

### Examples of Triggers
- Physical altercations or fights within the camera's range.

### Real-Time Decision-Making
The system responds promptly to suspicious triggers, enhancing security measures through quick, autonomous decision-making.

### Autonomous Analysis
The AI system autonomously examines video streams, eliminating the need for constant human intervention.

### Integration with Mobile App and Cloud Service
Overview
Integrate the AI-based home security system with a mobile application, utilizing cloud services for real-time data communication and sharing.
